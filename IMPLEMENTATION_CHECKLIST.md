# Travel App Implementation Checklist

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, React Query, shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (FastAPI managed)
- **Local Dev**: Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Backend/DB on Railway/Render, Frontend on Vercel

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Project structure setup - Create monorepo with frontend, backend, and database folders
- [ ] Environment configuration - Set up .env files and variable management for all environments
- [ ] Docker Compose setup - Configure containers for PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and React with networking

## Phase 2: Database & Backend Core
- [ ] Database setup - Configure PostgreSQL connection and SQLAlchemy models
- [ ] Alembic migration setup - Initialize migration environment and create initial schema
- [ ] FastAPI backend foundation - Set up basic API structure, CORS, and middleware

## Phase 3: Authentication & Security
- [ ] JWT authentication system - Implement user registration, login, token generation and validation
- [ ] Backend API endpoints - Create protected and public endpoints with proper error handling

## Phase 4: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] React frontend setup - Initialize TypeScript React app with routing and basic structure
- [ ] shadcn UI integration - Install and configure component library with theming
- [ ] React Query setup - Configure data fetching, caching, and API integration

## Phase 5: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Authentication frontend - Create login/register forms and JWT token management
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration - Connect React components to FastAPI endpoints
- [ ] Local development optimization - Ensure hot reload and proper container networking

## Phase 6: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Production configuration - Set up environment-specific configs for deployment
- [ ] Backend deployment prep - Configure Railway/Render deployment with database migration
- [ ] Frontend deployment prep - Configure Vercel deployment with environment variables

## Phase 7: Quality & Documentation
- [ ] Testing setup - Add basic unit and integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation - Create setup instructions and API documentation
